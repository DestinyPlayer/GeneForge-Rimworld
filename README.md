# Gene Forge

This mod adds a system that allows you to create Genepacks via a fluid.

I like being able to make things at home instead of having to depend on adventuring or trading, and genepacks have been a major pain in the ass for me.

So I made this.

## CHANGELOG

- Version 1.5.1: Slight tweaks to some stuff like descriptions and the source files.
