# Gene Forge

This mod adds a system that allows you to create Genepacks via a fluid.

I like being able to make things at home instead of having to depend on adventuring or trading, and genepacks have been a major pain in the ass for me.

So I made this.

## CHANGELOG

- Version 1.3.1: Removed that facility. I really cannot get it to work how I want it to to save my life.
- Version 1.3: Added a facility that's necessary for producing category-filtered genepacks.
- Version 1.2: Some research changes, plus compatibility for Warhammer 40k Genes and Psycasts.
- Version 1.1.2: Fixed the bug where pawns couldn't stuff category Genepacks into Gene Banks.
- Version 1.1.1: My dumbass screwed up a recipe for Mechanitor genepacks and didn't notice. Fixed.
- Version 1.1: Added the ability to craft more specific genepacks based on categories.
- Version 1.0: Made the dang mod!
